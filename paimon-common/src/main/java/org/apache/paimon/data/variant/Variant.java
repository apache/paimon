 * A Variant represents a type that contain one of: 1) Primitive: A type and corresponding value
 * (e.g. INT, STRING); 2) Array: An ordered list of Variant values; 3) Object: An unordered
 * collection of string/Variant pairs (i.e. key/value pairs). An object may not contain duplicate
 * keys.
 *
 * <p>A Variant is encoded with 2 binary values, the value and the metadata.
 *
 * <p>The Variant Binary Encoding allows representation of semi-structured data (e.g. JSON) in a
 * form that can be efficiently queried by path. The design is intended to allow efficient access to
 * nested data even in the presence of very wide or deep structures.
