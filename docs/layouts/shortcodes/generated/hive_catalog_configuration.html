The value of the configuration will be extracted from catalog properties and added to the cache key. A conf element should start with a "conf:" prefix which is followed by the configuration name. E.g. specifying "conf:a.b.c" will add "a.b.c" to the key, and so that configurations with different default catalog wouldn't share the same client pool. Multiple conf elements can be specified.</li></ul></td>
