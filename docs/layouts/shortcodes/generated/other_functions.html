        <td><h5>truncate(column,width)</h5></td>
        <td>truncate column by width. Output type is same with column.If the column is a STRING, truncate(column,width) will truncate the string to width characters, namely `value.substring(0, width)`.
             If the column is an INT or LONG, truncate(column,width) will truncate the number with the algorithm `v - (((v % W) + W) % W)`. The `redundant` compute part is to keep the result always positive.
             If the column is a DECIMAL, truncate(column,width) will truncate the decimal with the algorithm: let `scaled_W = decimal(W, scale(v))`, then return `v - (v % scaled_W)`.</td>
