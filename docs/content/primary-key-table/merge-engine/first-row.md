# First Row

By specifying `'merge-engine' = 'first-row'`, users can keep the first row of the same primary key. It differs from the
`deduplicate` merge engine that in the `first-row` merge engine, it will generate insert only changelog.

{{< hint info >}}
1. You can not specify [sequence.field]({{< ref "primary-key-table/sequence-rowkind#sequence-field" >}}).
2. Not accept `DELETE` and `UPDATE_BEFORE` message. You can config `ignore-delete` to ignore these two kinds records.
3. Visibility guarantee: Tables with First Row engine, the files with level 0 will only be visible after compaction.
   So by default, compaction is synchronous, and if asynchronous is turned on, there may be delays in the data.
   {{< /hint >}}

This is of great help in replacing log deduplication in streaming computation.
