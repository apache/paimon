# DLF Token

DLF (Data Lake Formation) building is a fully-managed platform for unified metadata and data storage and management,
aiming to provide customers with functions such as metadata management, storage management, permission management,
storage analysis, and storage optimization.

DLF provides multiple authentication methods for different environments.

{{< hint info >}}
The `'warehouse'` is your catalog instance name on the server, not the path.
{{< /hint >}}

## Use the access key

```sql
CREATE CATALOG `paimon-rest-catalog`
WITH (
    'type' = 'paimon',
    'uri' = '<catalog server url>',
    'metastore' = 'rest',
    'warehouse' = 'my_instance_name',
    'token.provider' = 'dlf',
    'dlf.access-key-id'='<access-key-id>',
    'dlf.access-key-secret'='<access-key-secret>',
);
```

- `uri`: Access the URI of the DLF Rest Catalog Server.
- `warehouse`: DLF Catalog name
- `token.provider`: token provider
- `dlf.access-key-id`: The Access Key ID required to access the DLF service, usually referring to the AccessKey of your
  RAM user
- `dlf.access-key-secret`:The Access Key Secret required to access the DLF service

You can grant specific permissions to a RAM user and use the RAM user's access key for long-term access to your DLF
resources. Compared to using the Alibaba Cloud account access key, accessing DLF resources with a RAM user access key
is more secure.

## Use the STS temporary access token

Through the STS service, you can generate temporary access tokens for users, allowing them to access DLF resources
restricted by policies within the validity period.

```sql
CREATE CATALOG `paimon-rest-catalog`
WITH (
    'type' = 'paimon',
    'uri' = '<catalog server url>',
    'metastore' = 'rest',
    'warehouse' = 'my_instance_name',
    'token.provider' = 'dlf',
    'dlf.access-key-id'='<access-key-id>',
    'dlf.access-key-secret'='<access-key-secret>',
    'dlf.security-token'='<security-token>'
);
```

In some environments, temporary access token can be periodically refreshed by using a local file:

```sql
CREATE CATALOG `paimon-rest-catalog`
WITH (
    'type' = 'paimon',
    'uri' = '<catalog server url>',
    'metastore' = 'rest',
    'warehouse' = 'my_instance_name',
    'token.provider' = 'dlf',
    'dlf.token-path' = 'my_token_path_in_disk'
);
```

## Use the STS token from aliyun ecs role

An instance RAM role refers to a RAM role granted to an ECS instance. This RAM role is a standard service role
with the trusted entity being the cloud server. By using an instance RAM role, it is possible to obtain temporary
access token (STS Token) within the ECS instance without configuring an AccessKey.

```sql
CREATE CATALOG `paimon-rest-catalog`
WITH (
    'type' = 'paimon',
    'uri' = '<catalog server url>',
    'metastore' = 'rest',
    'warehouse' = 'my_instance_name',
    'token.provider' = 'dlf',
    'dlf.token-loader' = 'ecs'
    -- optional, loader can obtain it through ecs metadata service
    -- 'dlf.token-ecs-role-name' = 'my_ecs_role_name'
);
```
