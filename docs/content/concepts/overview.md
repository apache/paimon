# Overview

Apache Paimon's Architecture:

{{< img src="/img/architecture.png">}}

As shown in the architecture above:

**Read/Write:** Paimon supports a versatile way to read/write data and perform OLAP queries.
- For reads, it supports consuming data
  - from historical snapshots (in batch mode),
  - from the latest offset (in streaming mode), or 
  - reading incremental snapshots in a hybrid way.
- For writes, it supports
  - streaming synchronization from the changelog of databases (CDC)
  - batch insert/overwrite from offline data.

**Ecosystem:** In addition to Apache Flink, Paimon also supports read by other computation
engines like Apache Spark, StarRocks, Apache Doris, Apache Hive and Trino.

**Internal:**
- Under the hood, Paimon stores the columnar files on the filesystem/object-store
- The metadata of the file is saved in the manifest file, providing large-scale storage and data skipping.
- For primary key table, uses the LSM tree structure to support a large volume of data updates and high-performance queries.

## Unified Storage

For streaming engines like Apache Flink, there are typically three types of connectors:
- Message queue, such as Apache Kafka, it is used in both source and 
  intermediate stages in this pipeline, to guarantee the latency stay
  within seconds.
- OLAP system, such as ClickHouse, it receives processed data in
  streaming fashion and serving userâ€™s ad-hoc queries. 
- Batch storage, such as Apache Hive, it supports various operations
  of the traditional batch processing, including `INSERT OVERWRITE`.

Paimon provides table abstraction. It is used in a way that
does not differ from the traditional database:
- In `batch` execution mode, it acts like a Hive table and
  supports various operations of Batch SQL. Query it to see the
  latest snapshot.
- In `streaming` execution mode, it acts like a message queue.
  Query it acts like querying a stream changelog from a message queue
  where historical data never expires.
