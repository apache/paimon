## Manifest

Manifest includes meta of several data files or changelog files. Its name contains UUID, it is a avro file.

The changes of the file are saved in the manifest, and the file can be added or deleted. Manifests should be in
an orderly manner, and the same file may be added or deleted multiple times. The last version should be read. This
design can make commit lighter to support file deletion generated by compaction.

The schema is:

1. kind: ADD or DELETE,
2. partition: partition spec, a BinaryRow.
3. bucket: bucket of this file.
4. totalBuckets: total buckets when write this file, it is used for verification after bucket changes.
5. file: data file meta.

1. fileName: file name.
2. fileSize: file size.
3. rowCount: total number of rows (including add & delete) in this file.
4. minKey: the minimum key of this file.
5. maxKey: the maximum key of this file.
6. keyStats: the statistics of the key.
7. valueStats: the statistics of the value.
8. minSequenceNumber: the minimum sequence number.
9. maxSequenceNumber: the maximum sequence number.
