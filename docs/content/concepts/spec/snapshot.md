# Snapshot

Each commit generates a snapshot file, and the version of the snapshot file starts from 1 and must be continuous.
`EARLIEST` and `LATEST` are hint files at the beginning and end of the snapshot list, and they can be inaccurate.
When hint files are inaccurate, the read will scan all snapshot files to determine the beginning and end.

```shell
warehouse
└── default.db
    └── my_table
        ├── snapshot
            ├── EARLIEST
            ├── LATEST
            ├── snapshot-1
            ├── snapshot-2
            └── snapshot-3
```

Writing commit will preempt the next snapshot id, and once the snapshot file is successfully written, this commit will
be visible.
