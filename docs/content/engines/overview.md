## Streaming Engines

### Flink Streaming

Flink is the most comprehensive streaming computing engine that is widely used for data CDC ingestion and the
construction of streaming pipelines.

Recommended version is Flink 1.17.2.

### Spark Streaming

You can also use Spark Streaming to build a streaming pipeline. Spark's schema evolution capability will be better
implemented, but you must accept the mechanism of mini-batch.

## Batch Engines

### Spark Batch

Spark Batch is the most widely used batch computing engine.

Recommended version is Spark 3.4.3.

### Flink Batch

Flink Batch is also available, which can make your pipeline more integrated with streaming and batch unified.

## OLAP Engines

### StarRocks

StarRocks is the most recommended OLAP engine with the most advanced integration.

Recommended version is StarRocks 3.2.6.

### Other OLAP

You can also use Doris and Trino and Presto, or, you can just use Spark, Flink and Hive to query Paimon tables.
