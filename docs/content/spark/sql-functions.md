# SQL Functions

This section introduce all available Paimon Spark functions.


## max_pt

`max_pt($table_name)`

It accepts a string type literal to specify the table name and return a max-valid-toplevel partition value.
- **valid**: the partition which contains data files
- **toplevel**: only return the first partition value if the table has multi-partition columns

It would throw exception when:
- the table is not a partitioned table
- the partitioned table does not have partition
- all of the partitions do not contains data files

**Example**

```sql
> SELECT max_pt('t');
 20250101
 
> SELECT * FROM t where pt = max_pt('t');
 a, 20250101
```

**Since: 1.1.0**
