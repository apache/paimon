# Apache Paimon

Apache Paimon is a lake format that enables building a Realtime Lakehouse Architecture with Flink and Spark 
for both streaming and batch operations. Paimon innovatively combines lake format and LSM (Log-structured merge-tree) 
structure, bringing realtime streaming updates into the lake architecture.

Paimon offers the following core capabilities:

- Realtime updates:
  - Primary key table supports writing of large-scale updates, has very high update performance, typically through Flink Streaming.
  - Support defining Merge Engines, update records however you like. Deduplicate to keep last row, or partial-update, or aggregate records, or first-row, you decide.
  - Support defining changelog-producer, produce correct and complete changelog in updates for merge engines, simplifying your streaming analytics.
- Huge Append Data Processing:
  - Append table (no primary-key) provides large scale batch & streaming processing capability. Automatic Small File Merge.
  - Supports Data Compaction with z-order sorting to optimize file layout, provides fast queries based on data skipping using indexes such as minmax.
- Data Lake Capabilities: 
  - Scalable metadata: supports storing Petabyte large-scale datasets and storing a large number of partitions.
  - Supports ACID Transactions & Time Travel & Schema Evolution.
