# Apache Amoro With Paimon

**[Apache Amoro(incubating)](https://amoro.apache.org)** is a Lakehouse management system built on open data lake formats. Working with compute engines including Flink, Spark, and Trino, Amoro brings pluggable and
**[Table Maintenance](https://amoro.apache.org/docs/latest/self-optimizing/)** features for a Lakehouse to provide out-of-the-box data warehouse experience, and helps data platforms or products easily build infra-decoupled, stream-and-batch-fused and lake-native architecture.
**[AMS](https://amoro.apache.org/docs/latest/#architecture)(Amoro Management Service)** provides Lakehouse management features, like self-optimizing, data expiration, etc. It also provides a unified catalog service for all compute engines, which can also be combined with existing metadata services like HMS(Hive Metastore).
