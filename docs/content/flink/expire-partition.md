## Expiring Partitions

You can set `partition.expiration-time` when creating a partitioned table. Paimon streaming sink will periodically check
the status of partitions and delete expired partitions according to time.

How to determine whether a partition has expired: compare the time extracted from the partition with the current
time to see if survival time has exceeded the `partition.expiration-time`.

{{< hint info >}}
__Note:__ After the partition expires, it is logically deleted and the latest snapshot cannot query its data. But the
files in the file system are not immediately physically deleted, it depends on when the corresponding snapshot expires.
See [Expire Snapshots]({{< ref "/maintenance/manage-snapshots#expire-snapshots" >}}).

An example for single partition field:
```sql
CREATE TABLE t (...) PARTITIONED BY (dt) WITH (
    'partition.expiration-time' = '7 d',
    'partition.expiration-check-interval' = '1 d',
    'partition.timestamp-formatter' = 'yyyyMMdd'
);
```

An example for multiple partition fields:
```sql
CREATE TABLE t (...) PARTITIONED BY (other_key, dt) WITH (
    'partition.expiration-time' = '7 d',
    'partition.expiration-check-interval' = '1 d',
    'partition.timestamp-formatter' = 'yyyyMMdd',
    'partition.timestamp-pattern' = '$dt'
);
```
