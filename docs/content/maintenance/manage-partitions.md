# Manage Partitions
Paimon provides multiple ways to manage partitions, including expire historical partitions by different strategies or 
mark a partition done to notify the downstream application that the partition has finished writing.

## Expiring Partitions

You can set `partition.expiration-time` when creating a partitioned table. Paimon streaming sink will periodically check
the status of partitions and delete expired partitions according to time.

How to determine whether a partition has expired: you can set `partition.expiration-strategy` when creating a partitioned table,
this strategy determines how to extract the partition time and compare it with the current time to see if survival time
has exceeded the `partition.expiration-time`. Expiration strategy supported values are:

- `values-time` : The strategy compares the time extracted from the partition value with the current time,
this strategy as the default.
- `update-time` : The strategy compares the last update time of the partition with the current time. 
What is the scenario for this strategy:
   - Your partition value is non-date formatted.
   - You only want to keep data that has been updated in the last n days/months/years.
   - Data initialization imports a large amount of historical data.

{{< hint info >}}
__Note:__ After the partition expires, it is logically deleted and the latest snapshot cannot query its data. But the
files in the file system are not immediately physically deleted, it depends on when the corresponding snapshot expires.
See [Expire Snapshots]({{< ref "/maintenance/manage-snapshots#expire-snapshots" >}}).

An example for single partition field:

`values-time` strategy.
```sql
CREATE TABLE t (...) PARTITIONED BY (dt) WITH (
    'partition.expiration-time' = '7 d',
    'partition.expiration-check-interval' = '1 d',
    'partition.timestamp-formatter' = 'yyyyMMdd'   -- this is required in `values-time` strategy.
);
-- Let's say now the date is 2024-07-09，so before the date of 2024-07-02 will expire.
insert into t values('pk', '2024-07-01');

-- An example for multiple partition fields
CREATE TABLE t (...) PARTITIONED BY (other_key, dt) WITH (
    'partition.expiration-time' = '7 d',
    'partition.expiration-check-interval' = '1 d',
    'partition.timestamp-formatter' = 'yyyyMMdd',
    'partition.timestamp-pattern' = '$dt'
);
```

`update-time` strategy.
```sql
CREATE TABLE t (...) PARTITIONED BY (dt) WITH (
    'partition.expiration-time' = '7 d',
    'partition.expiration-check-interval' = '1 d',
    'partition.expiration-strategy' = 'update-time'
);

-- The last update time of the partition is now, so it will not expire.
insert into t values('pk', '2024-01-01');
-- Support non-date formatted partition.
insert into t values('pk', 'par-1'); 

```

## Partition Mark Done

You can use the option `'partition.mark-done-action'` to configure the action when a partition needs to be mark done.
- `success-file`: add '_success' file to directory.
- `done-partition`: add 'xxx.done' partition to metastore.
- `mark-event`: mark partition event to metastore.
- `http-report`: report partition mark done to remote http server.
- `custom`: use policy class to create a mark-partition policy.
These actions can be configured at the same time: 'done-partition,success-file,mark-event,custom'.

Paimon partition mark done can be triggered both by streaming write and batch write.

### Streaming Mark Done

You can use the options `'partition.idle-time-to-done'` to set a partition idle time to done duration. When a partition 
has no new data after this time duration, the mark done action will be triggered to indicate that the data is ready.

By default, Flink will use process time as idle time to trigger partition mark done. You can also use watermark to 
trigger partition mark done. This will make the partition mark done time more accurate when data is delayed. You can
enable this by setting `'partition.mark-done-action.mode' = 'watermark'`.

### Batch Mark Done

For batch mode, you can trigger partition mark done when end input by setting `'partition.end-input-to-done'='true'`,
and all partitions written in this batch will be marked done.
