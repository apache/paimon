 * VFSInputStream wrap over paimon SeekableInputStream to support hadoop FSDataInputStream. TODO:
 * SeekableInputStream interface is too simple to fully support all FSDataInputStream operations: 1.
 * ByteBufferReadable and ByteBufferPositionedReadable should be implemented for full support. 2.
 * Positioned read is not supported in SeekableInputStream, so it is by default implemented by
 * sequence read, which is not a good solution.
